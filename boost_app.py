# The following python file runs the slack_demo_app for the powertrust app. The main function of this app is to provide companies to increase employee engagement by allowing
# employees to boost their collegues. This slack app also helps companies offset their scope 2 emmissions.

# The app currently runs on a virtual enviroment. For this file we pip installed the slack_bolt library.
